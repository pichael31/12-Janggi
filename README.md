# 12-Janggi

12 Janggi as shown on the South Korean TV Gameshow The Genius.  Turn based board game similar to Chess but much simpler.

Pvp Co-op or vs AI only using the mouse.  AI uses recursive dictionaries to view potential moves in a board state to create future board states, evaluate the new board states, and then pick the optimal move that assuming the player also picks the optimal move for them will result in the best evaluated board state.
Might only work on 1920 x 1080 resolution and Windows; haven't tested on others.
